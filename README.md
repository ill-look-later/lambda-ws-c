This is result of the workshop of Functional Romandie the 16/07/2015. 
You can see the github https://github.com/FunctionalRomandie/LambdaCalculusWorkshop.

- [Goals](GOALS.MD)
- [Implementation](IMPLEMENTATION.MD)
- [Garbage collection](GARBAGE.MD)
- Code generation (TBD)


- [Project requirements](REQUIREMENTS)

You can see the [blog](BLOG.MD) to see advance and changes... ;)

## And now what ?
For any question or issue you can write to me on twitter @ivanpierre. It's currently a WIP.

But as I have to manage all the data types to begin to put just a function call with a symbol in environment, I 
finish to have a complete functional language. Well this was the goal, as programming a functional language with a 
functional language is ways to easy ;)

Well, it will be when all the data types will be implemented.

But the BIG difficulty, is managing the memory, when we don't have an embedded garbage collector... :D
